# Roadmap

Welcome to the Basejump AI roadmap! We share this roadmap so Users can see what we are working on and have coming down the pipeline soon.

The considering section are items we are thinking about adding, to give your thoughts on what we should develop next, please go to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fUucrZyP7D) and let us know!

February 2025
:   
    - Integrations: Add Oracle, SQL Server, and Snowflake.
    - Add upload CSV feature.
    - Adding join guarantees so the AI will only use the defined joins in the metadata when defined. This will the improve the AI accuracy.

March 2025
:   
    - Add AWS S3 bucket storage option for users to store chat history and data results in their own storage.
    - Add Collections endpoints to the API.
    - Improve AI accuracy by leveraging reasoning models if the AI is not confident enough to answer the question.

Considering
:   
    - "Safe mode": where the AI will only return results previously generated by the data team/admin users.
    - VIEWER role: this role would be below MEMBER and would only allow the user to view data.
    - Allowing admins to upload SQL queries which can then be used as a data objects that are shareable.
    - Adding a 'ask a data analyst' button to send questions to the data team.
