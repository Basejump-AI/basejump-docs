# Roadmap

Welcome to the Basejump AI roadmap! We share this roadmap so Users can see what we are working on and have coming down the pipeline soon.

The considering section are items we are thinking about adding. To give your thoughts on what we should develop next, please go to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fUucrZyP7D) and let us know!

April 2025
:   
    - Adding join guarantees so the AI will only use the defined joins in the metadata when defined. This will the improve the AI accuracy.
    - Add AI model picker with other AI model options
    - Add observability page

May 2025
:   
    - Add embedded chats
    - Add caching for sub-prompts and individual metrics as opposed to caching an entire composite prompt
    - Add upload CSV feature
    - Add business glossary page
    - Completing public benchmarks to compare our AI

Doing, But Not Scheduled
:   
    - Add Collections endpoints to the API
    - Allowing admins to upload SQL queries which can then be used as a data objects that are shareable.

Considering
:   
    - Improve AI accuracy by leveraging reasoning models if the AI is not confident enough to answer the question.
    - VIEWER role: this role would be below MEMBER and would only allow the user to view data.
    - Team lead role: this role would be above MEMBER and below ADMIN and allow a user to manage teams.
    - Adding a 'ask a data analyst' button to send questions to the data team.
