### Verify Mode

There are two verify modes available:

- STRICT

![Verify mode options](/images/company/verify_mode_option.png)

Each of these control how much leniency the AI has to retrieve results.

Explore Mode   | Strict Mode
---    | ---
Allows the AI to make it's best attempt to retrieve the information. Verified results are returned, but that's unverified (non-human reviewed) results can also be returned. | Restricts the AI to only return information that has previously been reviewed and verified. This is for those who need a higher level of assurance and accuracy from what the AI is returning.
