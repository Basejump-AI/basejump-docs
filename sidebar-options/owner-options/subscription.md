## Managing Your Subscription

The Owner can also manage their subscription. All pricing tiers start with a free trial of 50 credits. If billing is set up, an additional 50 free credits are given.

When you initially create an account and don't have billing set up, your billing page will have the 'Purchase Additional Credits' button grayed out and inaccessible.

In order to pay for additional credits, you need to activate your account. Your account will automatically activate after the 14 day free trial period if you have set up billing.

The Billing page also includes a payment history section to see prior payments made.

### Starting Your Subscription

It is possible that the account may run out of credits before the free trial ends. If that occurs, you will get an error while chatting with the AI letting you know that you need pay for credits. To activate the subscription, go to the Billing page and select 'Activate Now' to start your subscription. This will charge the card that you have set up on file and fill your account with the allotted subscription credits based on your selected tier.

### Paying for Additional Credits

It is also possible that you will run out of the subscription credits in the time period you have selected (monthly/annually). Additional credits will automatically be billed to your account to avoid stopping the app functionality entirely, which would result in a poor user experience. Additional credits are purchased in Basejump credit blocks, 1 block is 500 credits. To manually pay for additional credits, go to the Billing page and select 'Pay for Additional Credits'.

### Upgrade/Change Your Plan

The cost of additional credits come at a premium over those included in your subscription. If you find yourself frequently getting charged additional credits, it's a good indication you need to upgrade your plan.

You may also want to upgrade if your current plan doesn't have all of the features you need. For example, the free tier doesn't have access to the API. The API is only available on the developer tier and higher. For more information about our pricing, please refer to our [Pricing Page](https://basejump.ai/pricing).
