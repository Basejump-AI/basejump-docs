The explore page the User understand their data sources better. The page has a tile for each datasource you have connected and is scoped to the team you currently have selected.

There are currently 2 options available in the context menu when hovering over a database tile: see diagram and explore tables. 

## See Diagram 
The diagram is an entity-relationships diagram (ERD) that is generated based on the metadata provided to the AI.

To update the diagram, you will need to edit the metadata - and more specifically you need to define foreign key relationships. Navigate to the datasources page for more information on how to edit metadata:

## Explore Tables
The other option allows the user to browse the tables that are available to them and the AI. It can help inform the questions that the User's ask and also help to realize the limitations of the data that is available. Tables are listed in the left sidebar and can be clicked to explore the information.
