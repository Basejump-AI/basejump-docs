## Adding a Collection

Click 'Add Collection' in the top-right to create a new collection. Then select 'Add Data Object' on the collections page or add a collection from a data object on the Data page. Collections can also be added to when data is initially retrieved when chatting with the AI either on the Chat page or in the Chat bar at the bottom of the screen.

The context menu available in the data tile has most of the same options as data tiles on the Data page. See the Data page for more information regarding the context menu:

## Sharing your Collection

You can share your collection with your teams by going to the ellipsis in the top-right corner and selecting 'Share with Team(s)'. Shared Collections will only show those data items that the team has access to. 

## Sorting your Collection

The data tiles can be moved into the order you prefer by clicking and holding the arrow icon in the top-right corner that appears on hover.
