# Data

> "In God we trust; all others must bring data" - W. Edwards Deming

The data page is the home page of our app for good reason! This page contains all of the saved data objects retrieved from chatting with the AI.

The data apge contains the three data object types:
- Metrics
- Records
- Datasets

An explanation of each is provided on the concepts page:

## Data Tile View

The tile view shows all data using data tiles.

## Context Menu

The ellipsis shown on each data object has the following drop-down menu items:

 ## Filtering & Search

 A data object can be searched by using the search bar. The data object will be searched based on the title and summary. Parial word match is used to match the relevant rows.

 Data can be filtered to the teams that were used to retrieve them using the team filter pills.

 ## Bulk Actions

 Data can be removed in bulk or added to a collection by clicking the check boxes for each data object. After selecting the data objects, the 'Bulk Actions' button will change color and allow you to select it. From there you can select the bulk action you wish to perform. 

 The Collections page is linked below for more information on Collections:

 If you don't see data that has been shared, refresh the data objects on the page by clicking the circular refresh arrow in the top left of the page.

 Once data has been shared, a link to that datasource can also be shared to quickly help a teammate find the data you are referencing. The link icon will be shown on hover.
