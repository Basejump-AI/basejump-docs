# API

The API documentation can be found using the following link: [API Reference](https://docs.basejump.ai/api/api-reference/)

The API can be used to automate interaction with the Basejump AI application and integrate the Basejump AI data agent with other software tools. It's also intended to allow the User flexibility to use the Basejump product using a different UI that they build themselves in addition to integrating the Basejump AI agent into another existing tool.

Besides offering capability to augment the intraction and automation experiences internal to a company, the API also allows companies to use Basejump AI as an AI data analytics vendor to supplement a service they already provide.

## Versioning and Releases

As releases are made, we will make announcements on our various social media platforms as well as via our newsletter. We use semantic versioning for our releases, which is displayed at the top of our API documentation linked above. Semantic versioning follows a standard of <major update>.<minor update>.<patch>.

The API endpoints include the API version in their endpoint paths. While the API is still in beta (i.e. less than 1.0.0). the endpoints will include all 3 semantic version numbers (e.g. version 0.27.0 will be v0_27_0). Once the API is out of beta, we will only the first 2 sections (i.e. major and minor updates). While the API is in beta, the patch section represents both minor and patch releases.

We will only support the latest 3 API releases at any given time (the latest release + 2 prior releases). We will provide deprecation warnings to anyone that has not upgraded to a new API version that the prior version will soon be deprecated. The frequency of releases will be greater while in beta. ONce out of beta, the releases will not be as frequent.
