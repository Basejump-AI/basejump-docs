# MySQL

MySQL is an open-source relational OLTP database (however OLAP software is available that has been built on top of the MySQL database).

## SSL/TLS Certificates

Since MySQL is open-source, either it will be self-hosted or hosted by a provider. Please refer to your providers documentation to find where to download the SSL/TLS root certificate.
