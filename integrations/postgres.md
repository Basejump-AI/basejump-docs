# Postgres

Postgres is an open-source relational OLTP database (however extensions can be used to support OLAP functionality).

## SSL/TLS Certificates

Since Postgres is open-source, either it will be self-hosted or hosted by a provider. Please refer to your providers documentation to find where to download the SSL/TLS root certificate.
