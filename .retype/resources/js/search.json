[[{"l":"Overview","p":["Basejump AI is an AI data analytics platform that allows you to chat with your data. We enable this by using AI data agents for your particular task. Our primary focus is a data agent which assists the data team as a vital member to answer ad hoc questions that others may have. Using AI to assist with data analytics will help users get access to information faster than ever before."]},{"l":"Company Mission Statement","p":["Make it easier for everyone, everywhere, to access reliable and trusted data quickly."]},{"l":"Vision","p":["Our long-term vision can be easily understood by focusing on how the business compares to different levels of data maturity. Our platform is an AI-first data analytics platform. What this means is leveraging data agents and giving them all the tools they need to help everyone in the organization succeed faster than ever before. The 5 levels of data maturity can be used to help understand how our organization will improve and evolve over time:","Ad Hoc and Reactive","Our data agent is meeting this need. We aim to have this mostly (over 50%) automated in the next 3 years.","Descriptive Reporting (“What happened”)","Our data agent will meet this need in coordination with data analysts. Our data agent will focus on the easier tasks and the more difficult tasks or more intricate dashboards will be handled by the data team.","Diagnostic Reporting (“Why did it happen?”)","The data agent will coordinate with the data analytics and data science teams to answer these questions. We will be adding data science capabilities to our data agent soon.","Predictive Analytics (“What will happen?”)","The data agent will assist the data science team with these questions leveraging machine learning and statistics to answer these questions.","Prescriptive Analytics (“How can we make it happen?”)","This is the most mature tier and difficult to achieve, but also the most impactful. The data agent will assist in creating action plans to coordinate efforts to act on data insights."]},{"l":"History","p":["By Andreas Martinson, Co-founder and CEO","My career as a data professional gave me a front-row seat to how AI will change data analytics in the future and I wanted to help shape that future by starting Basejump AI. I started my career as a data analyst, then became a data scientist and a data science lead. I have worked at enterprise level companies, I was the 3rd employee at a subsidiary created inside an enterprise as a 'startup with millions of instant funding', and also a startup with less than 10 people when I joined. Seeing how users interact with their data at these different company sizes gave me the confidence to start my own company with my co-founder, Joel Funk.","The company was originally called 'DemocratizeDB' since we believed using AI to assist with data analytics will result in a paradigm shift that would democratize data access. This shift will be similar in magnitude to when excel spreadsheets started becoming commonplace. The database is practically inaccessible without some sort of intermediary through the data team, however, in the future individuals will be able to chat with an AI to access information in the database quickly.","The company was rebranded to Basejump AI in 2024. Basejump is short for 'database jump' to express how many new people are essentially going to be 'taking the leap' into the vast amount of information available in company databases that are only available typically through interfaces such as dashboards.","We're confident that as AI abilities continue to progress that AI will assist with every stage of the data maturity cycle and we want to help that future become a reality as soon as possible. As data becomes both more available and reliable, it will improve the decision making capabilities of companies everywhere."]}],[{"l":"Getting Started"}],[{"l":"Quickstart","p":["Welcome to the Basejump AI quickstart!

We provide tools for User's to easily share their data objects and compare them to understand their differences. Traditional BI tools have made dashboards a priority with typically no data governance included. This led to a proliferation of dashboards with no easy way to compare them except to ask the data analysts why towo dashboards are showing different numbers for the same metric.","Comparing two data objects","Description","Different","Due to the democratization of access to the database that the Basejump AI platform will enable, Users will generate data objects faster than ever. This effect of improved access leading to increased utilization is known as Jevon's paradox.","Equivalent","Identical","It is imperative for an AI data analytics solution to provide means to compare and understand all of the data that is being retrieved and not miss an opportunity for built-in data governance.","One tool we provide to help understand the data is every piece of retrieved data has the original SQL query included. For User's on the same Team to compare their data objects, they can select the context menu within a data object and select 'Compare'.","Our AI tool will then compare the data in the two data objects and explain to the user how they compare using one of 4 designations (in order of similarity - most similar first):","Showing the 'Compare' selection on a metric","Similar","Similarity","The output and tables are the same, but queries are structured differently.","The queries share no tables.","The queries share some or all tables, but the output is different.","There are no differences between the queries used to retrieve the data.","We're offering the capability for organizations to go from first principles and original data sources to curate unique insights for the business that will transform the business into a truly data-driven enterprise like never before.

When Users mark a result as verified, it will add a checkmark to the result. Verification indicates that the user has reviewed the output and verifies that it is correct.","Verified result example","Verifying a result will add that result to the cache, which means it will return instantly for other users once it has been added.","There are 2 types of semantically similar results that can be returned in the cache:","Identical: These results will return the same information as was originally cached if it is current within the last day. If it is older than 1 day, then the result is refreshed.","Similar: These results will return different information, but the SQL query only differs in the where clause being applied. For example, if someone asks 'how many bagels are there?' and someone else asks, 'how many sesame seed bagels are there', the 2nd query is similar enough to be verified (we know how to count bagels), but will be updated to filter to sesame seed bagels only.","Other details to be aware of:","If a verified result is returned and is older than 1 day, the SQL query is re-ran in order get the latest information.","The checkmark symbol used to indicate if a result is verified is outlined if it was by a Member and solid if it was verified by an Admin","An Admin can confirm the verification of a Member to promote that verification to an admin","Verified results is a great initial step to getting common consensus around common metrics. Every time a result is returned, users can verify the output and other members will get the same query ran for them as well."]},{"l":"Unverifying a Result","p":["These verified results can also be unverified if another user disagrees that this information looks correct. However, a user has to be at the same RBAC role level or greater as the other user to unverify. For example, if the user is a Member, they can't unverify an Admin's verified result.","Once a result is unverified, prior verified results that were returned as verified based on that verified data object, will be unverified for anyone who received them. This ensure the highest level accuracy and agreement possible for human-verified information from the AI."]},{"l":"Security Implications","p":["Identical verified results are only returned for users who share a database connection through their teams. Similar results are only returned for an organization if two users share the same database, but not necessarily the same connection. This is important for situations where Users rely on jinjafied schemas. The query is re-ran to get the information relevant to the other user's connection, but the query itself remains verified.","This setup ensures that only those who have access to shared connections are able to view semantically similar information and keeps the data secure."]}],[{"l":"Integrations","p":["The Basejump AI platform currently integrates with 5 DBMS types:","MS SQL Server","MySQL","Postgres","Redshift","Snowflake","We can quickly add any integration listed on the SQLAlchemy dialects web page.

If your database does not offer encryption due to a missing server certificate, Basejump AI will refuse to connect.","There are 3 levels of TLS encryption available, referred to as SSL modes in the app:","Required: This creates an encrypted connection, but does not verify the CA cert","Verify CA: This creates an encrypted connection and verifies the CA cert","Verify Full: This creates an encrypted connection, verifies the CA cert, and verifies the host name in the CA cert","Verify full is most secure since it not only encrypts the connection and verifies the certificate, but also confirms the user is connecting to the correct source, which protects against man-in-the-middle attacks. However, this does come with some additional latency. We borrowed these classifications from the Postgres SSL definitions found here and standardized these same three categories to all of our database connections.","SSL is no longer in use and has been replaced with TLS, however, SSL is still commonly used to refer to an encrypted connection. All references to SSL throughout this documentation are referring to a TLS connection.","For more advanced encryption options such as mTSL or SSH tunneling, please contact us."]},{"l":"Setting up an Encrypted Connection","p":["When on the datasources page, click 'Add Database' to add a connection. You will see the SSL Mode dropdown that allows you to set your level of preferred protection.","SSL Mode Configuration","In order to use the Verify CA or Verify Full SSL Modes, the User needs to upload the root CA file which has the public key needed to verify the TLS certificate. If a public certificate authority (CA) was used to generate the server certificate, the User can go to the CA website and download their root certificate. If your certificate is self-signed, you will need to provide your server certificate with the certificate chain included so the root certificate can be verified.","If your DBMS is not self-hosted, DBMS providers usually provide their CA certificates for download.

Each team may have access to different database connections. This is controlled by an administrator. Reports can only be shared within teams to ensure that requisite access has been provided to view the information.","Additionally, when a database is added, the role associated with the username and password will be used to query the information. Therefore, the given database connection assigned to teams can only access the information based on that database role.","Finally, when indexing the information to provide to our AI, we only index the metadata and not the table information itself. The AI also only will see the same tables that a user has permission to see. This ensures that the AI is unable to provide any information that a user is not permitted to access."]},{"l":"2. AI","p":["We only partner with AI providers who do not train on customer data. We only use the database metadata to inform the AI and never index the rows from your data sources."]},{"l":"3.

There are 4 levels of token access (in order of most to least access):","API level","Account Owner","Admin","Member","Using tokens ensures that API secrets are not used frequently. Refresh tokens are required to be refreshed every 90 days and authentication tokens need to be refreshed every 15 minutes."]},{"l":"4. SCA (Software Composition Analysis)","p":["SCA is our first-line of defense to help write secure code. We scan our code as we’re writing it within our coding environment. Before we merge to production, we push our code to a staging environment. We ensure that the code has no vulnerabilities and any found vulnerabilities from our tool are resolved. We connect it to our Github staging repo so it can find any vulnerabilities before they make it to production. Only when all issues are resolved do we ship the code to production. Our tool also scans the code our software is dependent upon as well. This helps to ensure our code is not vulnerable due to security issues with other software. Before shipping to production, we also use a DAST tool to ensure the code is secure."]},{"l":"5. DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)","p":["DAST ensures that our application, regardless of the software used, is secure. It is our final security measure and uses pentesting methods to probe our app for vulnerabilities in the same way a malicious actor might. Before shipping to production, we run an automated scan on our staging application for both the web app and the API. We resolve all alerts that are above the ‘informational’ alert level. This test probes the web app unauthenticated. We then use a manual pentest scan within the tool as an authenticated user.
