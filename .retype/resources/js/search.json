[[{"l":"Overview","p":["Basejump AI is an AI data analytics platform that allows you to chat with your data. We enable this by using AI data agents for your particular task. Our primary focus is a data agent which assists the data team as a vital member to answer ad hoc questions that others may have. Using AI to assist with data analytics will help users get access to information faster than ever before."]},{"l":"Company Mission Statement","p":["Make it easier for everyone, everywhere, to access reliable and trusted data quickly."]},{"l":"Vision","p":["Our long-term vision can be easily understood by focusing on how the business compares to different levels of data maturity. Our platform is an AI-first data analytics platform. What this means is leveraging data agents and giving them all the tools they need to help everyone in the organization succeed faster than ever before. The 5 levels of data maturity can be used to help understand how our organization will improve and evolve over time:","Ad Hoc and Reactive","Our data agent is meeting this need. We aim to have this mostly (over 50%) automated in the next 3 years.","Descriptive Reporting (“What happened”)","Our data agent will meet this need in coordination with data analysts. Our data agent will focus on the easier tasks and the more difficult tasks or more intricate dashboards will be handled by the data team.","Diagnostic Reporting (“Why did it happen?”)","The data agent will coordinate with the data analytics and data science teams to answer these questions. We will be adding data science capabilities to our data agent soon.","Predictive Analytics (“What will happen?”)","The data agent will assist the data science team with these questions leveraging machine learning and statistics to answer these questions.","Prescriptive Analytics (“How can we make it happen?”)","This is the most mature tier and difficult to achieve, but also the most impactful. The data agent will assist in creating action plans to coordinate efforts to act on data insights."]},{"l":"History","p":["By Andreas Martinson, Co-founder and CEO","My career as a data professional gave me a front-row seat to how AI will change data analytics in the future and I wanted to help shape that future by starting Basejump AI. I started my career as a data analyst, then became a data scientist and a data science lead. I have worked at enterprise level companies, I was the 3rd employee at a subsidiary created inside an enterprise as a 'startup with millions of instant funding', and also a startup with less than 10 people when I joined. Seeing how users interact with their data at these different company sizes gave me the confidence to start my own company with my co-founder, Joel Funk.","The company was originally called 'DemocratizeDB' since we believed using AI to assist with data analytics will result in a paradigm shift that would democratize data access. This shift will be similar in magnitude to when excel spreadsheets started becoming commonplace. The database is practically inaccessible without some sort of intermediary through the data team, however, in the future individuals will be able to chat with an AI to access information in the database quickly.","The company was rebranded to Basejump AI in 2024. Basejump is short for 'database jump' to express how many new people are essentially going to be 'taking the leap' into the vast amount of information available in company databases that are only available typically through interfaces such as dashboards.","We're confident that as AI abilities continue to progress that AI will assist with every stage of the data maturity cycle and we want to help that future become a reality as soon as possible. As data becomes both more available and reliable, it will improve the decision making capabilities of companies everywhere."]}],[{"l":"Getting Started"}],[{"l":"Quickstart","p":["Welcome to the Basejump AI quickstart!

Then in order to generate your own data objects, either select the chat page in the sidebar or start chatting with the chat bar that is present throughout the app.","Your chat is scoped to whichever team you currently have selected. Each team has databases that have been provisioned by your company admin. If you are the initial user and created the account, then you will have admin privileges and will see an admin sidebar in addition to the typical sidebar that members see."]},{"l":"Adding a New Datasource","p":["The Datasources page","In order to get started chatting with your own data, you will need to add a datasource on the datasources page.

We provide tools for User's to easily share their data objects and compare them to understand their differences. Traditional BI tools have made dashboards a priority with typically no data governance included. This led to a proliferation of dashboards with no easy way to compare them except to ask the data analysts why towo dashboards are showing different numbers for the same metric.","Comparing two data objects","Description","Different","Due to the democratization of access to the database that the Basejump AI platform will enable, Users will generate data objects faster than ever.

However, this does come with some additional latency. We borrowed these classifications from the Postgres SSL definitions found here and standardized these same three categories to all of our database connections.","SSL is no longer in use and has been replaced with TLS, however, SSL is still commonly used to refer to an encrypted connection. All references to SSL throughout this documentation are referring to a TLS connection.","For more advanced encryption options such as mTSL or SSH tunneling, please contact us."]},{"l":"Setting up an Encrypted Connection","p":["When on the datasources page, click 'Add Database' to add a connection.

A client secret is an API key that is extremely sensitive and should not be widely shared since the client secret is used to create users within the organization along with other privileged actions that manage access to the application. Client secrets have a role associated with them. A user can only create client secrets below their current privilege level. However, only the OWNER role currently is allowed to create client secrets. An OWNER can only create an OWNER level client secret through the Basejump UI.","A client secret given to a user from an OWNER allows that user to create other users if that client secret role is an ADMIN. Just like creating a client secret, users can only create other users below their current role. This means only the OWNER role can create an ADMIN. Both the OWNER and ADMIN roles can create a MEMBER. If the client secret role is a MEMBER, the MEMBER can't create users since they are already the least privileged role. However, the client secret can be used to create their own MEMBER-level refresh and access tokens."]},{"l":"Adding an API Key","p":["Navigate to the API key management page within the Basejump UI. Only the account owner will see the API key page.

Keys can also be given to other developers.
