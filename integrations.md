# Integrations

The Basejump AI platform currently integrates with 3 DBMS types:
- Postgres
- MySQL
- Redshift

We can quickly add any integration listed on the [SQLAlchemy dialects](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/) web page. To request a new integration be added, please email support@basejump.ai with the same email you used to create your account.
